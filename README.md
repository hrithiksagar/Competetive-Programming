# Competetive-Programming-
<h2> This Repo consists of all the Programs/Algorithms that I practice over time, in my entire competetive programming journey.
Feel free to DM me to do write customized codes. <h2>
<h3> Starts with basic C++ programs such as input and putput functions to Data structures and algorithms in time of my placement preparation
Every program has its own description for clear understaing <h3>
 Ps: it takes time to keep uploading new codes and this takes minimum of 4 - 6 months of time!

 Update: After 1 and half month of preparation, now I'm following the same path using python and c++ both languages so that things get clearer and at the same time I'll be able to learn both the Languages
 
<h2> Every code has a description of 
 
 --> What is the problem statement.
 
 --> how to solve, approach to the perticular problem.
 
 --> Rough solution idea describing how to solve it using coding.
 
 --> Then the final fuly functioning coded program.
